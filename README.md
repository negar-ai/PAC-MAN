Pac-Man In Real World <br/>This project is implemented in Amir Abad, near the University of Tehran. <br/>The Ghost part is to be completed. <br/>The user starts at a designated point and controls Pac-Man, who moves as the user walks. Coins on the street can be collected when Pac-Man is within a specific range. Each coin awards points, and reaching a point threshold reveals a fruit, which gives you extra points. Ghosts patrol the streets and must be avoided. The game is won by collecting all coins.
